# Credit-Card-Default-Prediction

### Problem Statement
Financial threats are displaying a trend in the credit risk of commercial banks as the incredible improvement in the financial industry has arisen. In this way, one of the biggest threats faced by commercial banks is the risk prediction of credit clients. The goal is to predict the probability of credit default based on the credit card owner's characteristics and payment history.

### Solution Proposed
There are two solutions here, the first is developing a web-based API interface for us to predict whether customer will default next month or not based on the details of the customer and the second approach is using batch prediction in which a csv file containing all the customer details will be taken as batch input and will generate a prediction file for each customer as an output.

### Tech Stack Used
1. Python
2. VS Code
3. Jupyter Notebook
4. Machine Learning Algorithms
5. Docker
6. MongoDB

### Infrastructure Required
1. AWS EC2
2. AWS ECR
3. AWS S3
4. GitHub Actions
5. Apache Airflow

### How to run?
Before we run the project, make sure that you are having MongoDB in your local system, with Compass since we are using MongoDB for data storage. You also need AWS account to access the service like S3, ECR and EC2 instances.
